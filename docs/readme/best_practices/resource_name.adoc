=== Resource Name Lengths

Azure has strict name length requirements for different resource types:

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Resource Type |Max Length |Recommendation

|Storage Account
|3-24 characters
|Use `short_name_length = 3` for very long company/project names

|Key Vault
|3-24 characters
|Keep company and project names concise

|Resource Group
|1-90 characters
|Standard naming works well

|Container Registry
|5-50 characters
|Standard naming works well
|===

[TIP]
====
If you encounter name length issues, reduce `short_name_length`:

[source,hcl]
----
module "foundation" {
  source            = "./stacks-foundation-azure"
  short_name_length = 3  # Instead of default 4
  # ... other variables
}
----
