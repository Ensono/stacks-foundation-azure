=== Workspace Strategy

Use Terraform workspaces to differentiate environments:

[source,bash]
----
# Create workspaces for each environment
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new test
terraform workspace new prod

# Always verify current workspace
terraform workspace show

# Deploy to specific environment
terraform workspace select prod
terraform apply
----

[WARNING]
====
Always verify the active workspace before applying changes. Resource names include the workspace name, so incorrect workspace selection will deploy to the wrong environment.
