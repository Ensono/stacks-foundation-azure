== Best Practices

=== Code Style

- Use `terraform fmt` before committing
- Add descriptions to all variables and outputs
- Comment complex local transformations
- Keep lines under 120 characters

=== Documentation

- Update API docs by rebuilding (don't edit `tfdocs.adoc` manually)
- Keep module docs focused on usage
- Keep repository docs focused on development
- Use examples liberally
- Document breaking changes prominently

=== Testing

- Test with multiple projects in `var.project`
- Test with different regions
- Test with different workspace names
- Verify name lengths for Azure resource limits
- Test environment file generation

=== Git Workflow

[source,bash]
----
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-capability

# Make changes and test
# ...

# Commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat(naming): add support for new resource type"
git commit -m "docs: update usage examples"
git commit -m "fix(regions): correct geography filter"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/new-capability
----

=== Commit Message Convention

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test updates
- `build:` - Build system changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
